# 🌿 About The Pioneer Forest (Medium)

**The Pioneer Forest (TPF)** is a global, community-driven environmental initiative within the Pi Network ecosystem.

Pioneers from all over the world contribute symbolically, helping restore biodiversity, combat climate change, and support local communities.

**Vision:**  
> “Go Pi. Go Green. Go The Pioneer Forest.”

🌱 Minimum offset: ≈ 30 kg CO₂ per Pi
